# React Scaffold Lite

CRA (create react app) is great, but it is way too verbose for a small toy project. So I often find myself using codesandbox to try small react projects. 

So I handcrafted a minimal version of scaffold which works great for small toy projects.


## Features

1. Local development with complete sourcemap support for better debugging
2. Dev Server
3. Modern es6 code support
